Project Title :- Power-BI-Live-Weather-Dashboard-Project-Real-Time-Weather-from-5-Cities-
🚀 Just wrapped up one of my favorite data projects – building a fully interactive Weather Dashboard in Power BI, using real-time data from weatherapi.com! 🔥
📌 Here’s what I did:
✅ API Integration
🔗 I created a free account on weatherapi.com and received my API key.
🌐 Using the API documentation, I copied the endpoint URL for the current weather data (example: https://lnkd.in/gfjKSK-F)
📊 Then in Power BI, I used “Get Data > Web” and pasted the API URL to extract live weather data!
✅ Multi-City Report
🌍 I created a weather report for 5 major Indian cities: Gurgaon, Hyderabad, New Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore using multiple API calls.
✅ Custom Columns & DAX Measures
📈 I used DAX to create calculated columns and measures (like Air Quality Index, Wind Speed conversions, Temperature trends, Rain % chance, etc.) to enrich the dataset and support powerful visualizations.
✅ Advanced Visualizations
 🎨 Designed a modern weather dashboard UI with:
Forecast charts 🌡
AQI indicators ☢️
Rain probability bars ☔
Sunrise/Sunset timings 🌅
Live Temperature, Wind, UV Index, Humidity visuals 💨
💡 Tools & Skills Used:
Power BI (Data Modeling, DAX, Visualizations)
API Integration (weatherapi.com)
JSON Data Transformation
UX-focused Dashboard Design
📸 Here's a snapshot of the final dashboard 👇
